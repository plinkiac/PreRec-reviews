RICH:
Hi, Jack.

JACK:
Hi, Rich.

RICH:
Uh, today we're going to talk about just the games we've been playing lately, because quite frankly there were no releases that looked in any way, shape, or form looked interesting.

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
So I'm just like,
"Fuck it."
I'm just gonna talk about FTL.
I, I may as well start.
Uh, I guess I've been playing, uh, Grand Theft Auto V, which everybody knows is the, like, seventh or ninth Grand Theft Auto game that is called five because, ehh, whatever.
We don't know how to count.

LAMAR:
Ha!
Gangsta shit.

RICH:
I know they just recently re-released it on the PS4 and the PC and all that jazz, and it's the bigger, fancier version.
But I just have the PS3 version because fuck it.
I bought it when it was new, and that was a dumb thing to do, apparently.
Grand Theft Auto is an open-world game, and, and you can basically just do whatever you want.
They call it...
It's the original sandbox game and I think the reason you're a criminal in these games is just so you have an excuse to just start hitting somebody in the face.
And that's fine in Grand Theft Auto's world.
And you play as a thief, so thematically it's okay.
And, you know, you, you do missions, and you do general crime stuff.
But, you know, the focus has always been on, on just having fun.

MICHAEL:
Fuck!

RICH:
V is more fun that IV.

JACK:
By one degree.

RICH:
By, by...
No.
By more than one degree.
IV was boring.

CLUCKIN' BELL EMPLOYEE:
Hi, welcome to Cluckin' Bell.
What can I get for you?
There.

NIKO:
Thank you very much.

RICH:
And, and with V, they took a step back from that.
They're like,
"You know, maybe, maybe this should have been fun."
"The car physics are a little bit goofy, but it's fun."
And that's great.
That was great.
The gimmick in V was the three different main characters.
And I know I'm old now, right?
Because you got the young guy, the crazy guy, and the middle-aged family guy.
I identify with the middle-aged family guy.
That's the one I can see mys-, yeah.
I'm, I'm Michael.
I'm Michael.
I'm not the young guy anymore...

JACK:
Oh.

RICH:
In Grand Theft Auto.
I'm the old guy.

JACK:
I'm sorry, Rich.

RICH:
It's okay.
So I've been playing Grand Theft Auto V.
And you know what?
I haven't even been focusing on story missions much.
I just drive around in that game and I have fun.

JACK:
That, I think that's been, like, the, the trademark of all of the really good Grand Theft Auto games is just walking around, is like...

RICH:
Be like,
"I'm in a fucking city."

JACK:
Right!
I'm in a city, and I'm not a real person, so let's just see what I can get away with.

RICH:
You could get on a bus and go to a real city, all right?
But you can't just randomly punch people in the face if you do that.

JIMMY:
Hey, let's bounce.

MICHAEL:
Bounce.
We're bouncing now.

RICH:
So, Jack.
What have you been playing?

JACK:
I want to talk about this game that I've been playing called Super Time Force Ultra.
This game is a side-scrolling action game.
Uh, much in the vein of Contra, Mega Man, that kind of stuff.
It has pixel art.
It has a ton of humor and, like, potty humor.
Uh, and it is a action-packed shoot-em-up.
Yet I don't like it.

RICH:
So you've been playing a game that you don't like.

JACK:
Because all of the elements of this game say that I should like it.
I like pixel art.
I like shooty games.
I like side-scrollers.
And I like potty humor.
Yet here we have Super Time Force Ultra, and I don't like it.

RICH:
That's fascinating.

JACK:
It is.
It's weird is what it is.

RICH:
Do you know why you don't like it?

JACK:
On one hand, it's this very simple shooter.
You get different characters.
They have different guns, different powers.
It's super fun.
But then on the other hand, you have this really complicated time manipulation mechanic.
And that's, and those, those two parts of the game don't mesh in my tiny crocodile brain.
Because it's supposed to be this simple fun action game, and every time I find myself getting into the flow of the action, I run out of time.
Or my character dies.
Which is something that's supposed to happen in the game.
Because the whole selling point of this game is this time-warping mechanic where you're character can die, you can rewind time, and then choose a different character to play the same character, and then you're both on-screen at the same time.

RICH:
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
It kind of remembers what you did?

JACK:
Exactly.
And so then you have two people fighting the same enemy.
And then if you die again, you can have three people.
And if you die again, you can have four people.
And you can use different power-ups, and different attributes while maniuplating time back and forth.
The selling point of this game, this unique time mechanic, is what kills it for me.
Because I find myself really having fun until I have to rewind time.
RICH:
Graphically, I'm okay with pixel art.
But it seems like just the way the screen flashes and whatnot, it looks really confusing just to look at that game.

JACK:
It is.

RICH:
There's blue things flying at you, and I'm like,
"What the fuck is that?"

JACK:
Yup.

RICH:
How can you tell where you are with all this shit going on?

JACK:
There's blue things flying at you.
There's a ton of your characters running around.
There's little flashing things that you need to pick up.
All of the bullets look like the flashing things you need to pick up.
But it's okay if you get hit by one of the bullets, because you can just rewind time.
But then there's another character also cluttering up the screen.
It is a hot mess.
Rich.
Goddammit.
What else have you been playing?

RICH:
I"ve been
 playing an old game.
A very, very old game.
And I absolutely love every fucking minute of it.

THRAWN:
This Rebel stronghold has no hope of escape.
Commence the attack.

OFFICER:
Yes, sir.

RICH:
GOG.com, who I talked very fond...

JACK:
Good Old 
Games.

RICH:
Goodoldgames.com.
They sell DRM-free games -- most of them are older games -- but that's okay because they just released TIE Fighter.

JACK:
What the fuck is TIE Fighter?

RICH:
TIE mothe
rfucking Fighter, Jack...
You know what a Star Wars is.
Don't play coy with me.

JACK:
How many 
Star Wars are in this game?

RICH:
There is, there is precisely one Star Wars in this game, and it's at the beginning as it flies back from the camera.
TIE Figher is, is a game where you fly around in a little spaceship and you shoot at things.
Uh, superficially, if you didn't know anything about TIE Fighter, you might compare it to the Rogue Squadron games.
Where you fly around in an X-Wing and you shoot TIE Fighters and whatnot.
But this is actually more of a simulator than an arcadey type of game.

JACK:
And what would you say the difference between an arcadey and a simulator?

RICH:
An arcade
y game, like the Rogue Squadrons, or, or like Star Fox, it's, it's, it's not trying to recreate what it's like to fly, it's just, it just gives you a little ship on the screen, and it lets you just shoot at things.
And you don't really have to worry about anything other than maybe a little bit of steering and what you're shooting at next.

JACK:
Very simp
le controls.

RICH:
Yes.
Very simple controls.
TIE Fighter asks you to fly a starship, all right?
Uh, I, I, I, I'm gonna have to dig it out.
Somewhere in my closet, I still got, like, the original box to this game.
And this game actually ships with a full car.
It's like a sheet this big.
And it lists every key in the game and what it does, all right?
There is a key for transferring energy to and from your shields.
There's a key for transferring energy to and from your laser beams.
There's a key that sets your throttle to one-third speed, another one for two-thirds, and then full throttle, and then no throttle at all.
And then there's another key that how much power you have to the tractor beam.
And then there's another key for switching between targets.
But then you can save those targets by hitting shift + F5, or like shift + F6.
And then you got two save spots, so if you wanna re-target a ship you had pi-, you had targeted hours ago, you can go back to that ship so you can re-target it.

JACK:
Jesus Christ.

RICH:
It's, it's like a science fiction flight simulator, all right?
It's like Microsoft Flight: Spaceships.

JACK:
This sounds terribly boring.

RICH:
It sounds terribly complicated.

JACK:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
And, and, and it's, it's wonderful.
I'm sure in Rogue, Rogue Squadron, it's great just to shoot at things.

JACK:
Sure.

RICH:
But this,
 it's like you have to know what your'e doing in order to shoot at the things.
And for me, personally, it just makes it that much more satisfying.
It's like you're not just following a ship.
You gotta worry about throttliing down, because he's decreasing his speed, hoping you'll overshoot him so he can get a beat on you.
So you gotta be careful about what speed you're flying around.
But if you slow down in order to shoot the guy behind you, you're slowing down, so other, other ships might be getting on your back then to shoot at you.
So you might have to dodge really quick.
It's great!
It's great.
And that's, that's just the flying mechanics, all right?

JACK:
There's more?

RICH:
There's more to this game.
Um, I, I love kind of the way they handle difficulty.
There are primary objectives which are simple enough to do, where just, defend the, the base.
And if you defend the base, you, you got the primary objective, you go on to the next level, right?
There's also secondary objectives.
Secondary extra things you can do to further the Empire's goals because you're an evil motherfucking TIE fighter pilot who's trying to crush the Rebellion...

JACK:
Okay.

RICH:
And preserve peace and order in the galaxy from those chaotic Rebel motherfuckers and the pirate scum they hang out with.
So, so, in the secondary objective, instead of just defending the base, they might want you to, like, use your systems to scan what's on the other ships so they know what kind of supplies that the enemy forces are using.
And you might, you might get more points just by doing the secondary objectives.
But it's harder to do.
You know?
Instead, of just shooting at that ship that's in front of you, you might have to get close enough to scan it first.
And then outside of the primary objectives and the secondary objectives, there are secret objectives, which means you're going above and beyond to preserve the Empire.

JACK:
You're a nerd.

RICH
 like, it sounds like a game that would have an incredible learning curve, but once you got the muscle memory down to know what everything does, it would be an incredibly immersive experience.

RICH:
I, I can definitely attest to the fact that it's immersive.
As far as the learning curve, I've been playing this game since I was a younger person.
Basically, I, I've played the game since the time it came out originally.
So I, I can't even say how long it takes to get into it because I've, I've been into it ever since.

JACK:
But it is newly-released.

RICH:
New, newly-released on gog.com.

PALPATINE:
The Empire is on the verge of success.
