RICH:
Hi, Jack.

JACK:
Hi, Rich.

RICH:
Uh, today we're going to talk about just the games we've been playing lately, because quite frankly there were no releases that looked in any way, shape, or form looked interesting.

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
So I'm just like,
"Fuck it."
I'm just gonna talk about FTL.
I, I may as well start.
Uh, I guess I've been playing, uh, Grand Theft Auto V, which everybody knows is the, like, seventh or ninth Grand Theft Auto game that is called five because, ehh, whatever.
We don't know how to count.

LAMAR:
Ha!
Gangsta shit.

RICH:
I know they just recently re-released it on the PS4 and the PC and all that jazz, and it's the bigger, fancier version.
But I just have the PS3 version because fuck it.
I bought it when it was new, and that was a dumb thing to do, apparently.
Grand Theft Auto is an open-world game, and, and you can basically just do whatever you want.
They call it...
It's the original sandbox game and I think the reason you're a criminal in these games is just so you have an excuse to just start hitting somebody in the face.
And that's fine in Grand Theft Auto's world.
And you play as a thief, so thematically it's okay.
And, you know, you, you do missions, and you do general crime stuff.
But, you know, the focus has always been on, on just having fun.

MICHAEL:
Fuck!

RICH:
V is more fun that IV.

JACK:
By one degree.

RICH:
By, by...
No.
By more than one degree.
IV was boring.

CLUCKIN' BELL EMPLOYEE:
Hi, welcome to Cluckin' Bell.
What can I get for you?
There.

NIKO:
Thank you very much.

RICH:
And, and with V, they took a step back from that.
They're like,
"You know, maybe, maybe this should have been fun."
"The car physics are a little bit goofy, but it's fun."
And that's great.
That was great.
The gimmick in V was the three different main characters.
And I know I'm old now, right?
Because you got the young guy, the crazy guy, and the middle-aged family guy.
I identify with the middle-aged family guy.
That's the one I can see mys-, yeah.
I'm, I'm Michael.
I'm Michael.
I'm not the young guy anymore...

JACK:
Oh.

RICH:
In Grand Theft Auto.
I'm the old guy.

JACK:
I'm sorry, Rich.

RICH:
It's okay.
So I've been playing Grand Theft Auto V.
And you know what?
I haven't even been focusing on story missions much.
I just drive around in that game and I have fun.

JACK:
That, I think that's been, like, the, the trademark of all of the really good Grand Theft Auto games is just walking around, is like...

RICH:
Be like,
"I'm in a fucking city."

JACK:
Right!
I'm in a city, and I'm not a real person, so let's just see what I can get away with.

RICH:
You could get on a bus and go to a real city, all right?
But you can't just randomly punch people in the face if you do that.

JIMMY:
Hey, let's bounce.

MICHAEL:
Bounce.
We're bouncing now.

RICH:
So, Jack.
What have you been playing?

JACK:
I want to talk about this game that I've been playing called Super Time Force Ultra.
This game is a side-scrolling action game.
Uh, much in the vein of Contra, Mega Man, that kind of stuff.
It has pixel art.
It has a ton of humor and, like, potty humor.
Uh, and it is a action-packed shoot-em-up.
Yet I don't like it.

RICH:
So you've been playing a game that you don't like.

JACK:
Because all of the elements of this game say that I should like it.
I like pixel art.
I like shooty games.
I like side-scrollers.
And I like potty humor.
Yet here we have Super Time Force Ultra, and I don't like it.

RICH:
That's fascinating.
