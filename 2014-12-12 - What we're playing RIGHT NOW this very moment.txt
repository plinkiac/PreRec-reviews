RICH:
Hi, Jack.

JACK:
Hi, Rich.

RICH:
Uh, today we're going to talk about just the games we've been playing lately, because quite frankly there were no releases that looked in any way, shape, or form looked interesting.

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
So I'm just like,
"Fuck it."
I'm just gonna talk about FTL.
I, I may as well start.
Uh, I guess I've been playing, uh, Grand Theft Auto V, which everybody knows is the, like, seventh or ninth Grand Theft Auto game that is called five because, ehh, whatever.
We don't know how to count.

LAMAR:
Ha!
Gangsta shit.

RICH:
I know they just recently re-released it on the PS4 and the PC and all that jazz, and it's the bigger, fancier version.
But I just have the PS3 version because fuck it.
I bought it when it was new, and that was a dumb thing to do, apparently.
Grand Theft Auto is an open-world game, and, and you can basically just do whatever you want.
They call it...
It's the original sandbox game and I think the reason you're a criminal in these games is just so you have an excuse to just start hitting somebody in the face.
And that's fine in Grand Theft Auto's world.
And you play as a thief, so thematically it's okay.
And, you know, you, you do missions, and you do general crime stuff.
But, you know, the focus has always been on, on just having fun.

MICHAEL:
Fuck!

RICH:
V is more fun that IV.

JACK:
By one degree.

RICH:
By, by...
No.
By more than one degree.
IV was boring.

CLUCKIN' BELL EMPLOYEE:
Hi, welcome to Cluckin' Bell.
What can I get for you?
There.

NIKO:
Thank you very much.

RICH:
And, and with V, they took a step back from that.
They're like,
"You know, maybe, maybe this should have been fun."
"The car physics are a little bit goofy, but it's fun."
And that's great.
That was great.
The gimmick in V was the three different main characters.
And I know I'm old now, right?
Because you got the young guy, the crazy guy, and the middle-aged family guy.
I identify with the middle-aged family guy.
That's the one I can see mys-, yeah.
I'm, I'm Michael.
I'm Michael.
I'm not the young guy anymore...

JACK:
Oh.

RICH:
In Grand Theft Auto.
I'm the old guy.

JACK:
I'm sorry, Rich.

RICH:
It's okay.
So I've been playing Grand Theft Auto V.
And you know what?
I haven't even been focusing on story missions much.
I just drive around in that game and I have fun.

JACK:
That, I think that's been, like, the, the trademark of all of the really good Grand Theft Auto games is just walking around, is like...

RICH:
Be like,
"I'm in a fucking city."

JACK:
Right!
I'm in a city, and I'm not a real person, so let's just see what I can get away with.

RICH:
You could get on a bus and go to a real city, all right?
But you can't just randomly punch people in the face if you do that.

JIMMY:
Hey, let's bounce.

MICHAEL:
Bounce.
We're bouncing now.

RICH:
So, Jack.
What have you been playing?

JACK:
I want to talk about this game that I've been playing called Super Time Force Ultra.
This game is a side-scrolling action game.
Uh, much in the vein of Contra, Mega Man, that kind of stuff.
It has pixel art.
It has a ton of humor and, like, potty humor.
Uh, and it is a action-packed shoot-em-up.
Yet I don't like it.

RICH:
So you've been playing a game that you don't like.

JACK:
Because all of the elements of this game say that I should like it.
I like pixel art.
I like shooty games.
I like side-scrollers.
And I like potty humor.
Yet here we have Super Time Force Ultra, and I don't like it.

RICH:
That's fascinating.

JACK:
It is.
It's weird is what it is.

RICH:
Do you know why you don't like it?

JACK:
On one hand, it's this very simple shooter.
You get different characters.
They have different guns, different powers.
It's super fun.
But then on the other hand, you have this really complicated time manipulation mechanic.
And that's, and those, those two parts of the game don't mesh in my tiny crocodile brain.
Because it's supposed to be this simple fun action game, and every time I find myself getting into the flow of the action, I run out of time.
Or my character dies.
Which is something that's supposed to happen in the game.
Because the whole selling point of this game is this time-warping mechanic where you're character can die, you can rewind time, and then choose a different character to play the same character, and then you're both on-screen at the same time.

RICH:
Oh.
Okay.
Okay.
It kind of remembers what you did?

JACK:
Exactly.
And so then you have two people fighting the same enemy.
And then if you die again, you can have three people.
And if you die again, you can have four people.
And you can use different power-ups, and different attributes while maniuplating time back and forth.
The selling point of this game, this unique time mechanic, is what kills it for me.
Because I find myself really having fun until I have to rewind time.
RICH:
Graphically, I'm okay with pixel art.
But it seems like just the way the screen flashes and whatnot, it looks really confusing just to look at that game.

JACK:
It is.

RICH:
There's blue things flying at you, and I'm like,
"What the fuck is that?"

JACK:
Yup.

RICH:
How can you tell where you are with all this shit going on?

JACK:
There's blue things flying at you.
There's a ton of your characters running around.
There's little flashing things that you need to pick up.
All of the bullets look like the flashing things you need to pick up.
But it's okay if you get hit by one of the bullets, because you can just rewind time.
But then there's another character also cluttering up the screen.
It is a hot mess.
Rich.
Goddammit.
What else have you been playing?

RICH:
I"ve been
 playing an old game.
A very, very old game.
And I absolutely love every fucking minute of it.

THRAWN:
This Rebel stronghold has no hope of escape.
Commence the attack.

OFFICER:
Yes, sir.

RICH:
GOG.com, who I talked very fond...

JACK:
Good Old 
Games.

RICH:
Goodoldgames.com.
They sell DRM-free games -- most of them are older games -- but that's okay because they just released TIE Fighter.

JACK:
What the fuck is TIE Fighter?

RICH:
TIE mothe
rfucking Fighter, Jack...
You know what a Star Wars is.
Don't play coy with me.

JACK:
How many 
Star Wars are in this game?

RICH:
There is, there is precisely one Star Wars in this game, and it's at the beginning as it flies back from the camera.
TIE Figher is, is a game where you fly around in a little spaceship and you shoot at things.
Uh, superficially, if you didn't know anything about TIE Fighter, you might compare it to the Rogue Squadron games.
Where you fly around in an X-Wing and you shoot TIE Fighters and whatnot.
But this is actually more of a simulator than an arcadey type of game.

JACK:
And what would you say the difference between an arcadey and a simulator?

RICH:
An arcade
y game, like the Rogue Squadrons, or, or like Star Fox, it's, it's, it's not trying to recreate what it's like to fly, it's just, it just gives you a little ship on the screen, and it lets you just shoot at things.
And you don't really have to worry about anything other than maybe a little bit of steering and what you're shooting at next.

JACK:
Very simp
le controls.

RICH:
Yes.
Very simple controls.
TIE Fighter asks you to fly a starship, all right?
Uh, I, I, I, I'm gonna have to dig it out.
Somewhere in my closet, I still got, like, the original box to this game.
And this game actually ships with a full car.
It's like a sheet this big.
And it lists every key in the game and what it does, all right?
There is a key for transferring energy to and from your shields.
There's a key for transferring energy to and from your laser beams.
There's a key that sets your throttle to one-third speed, another one for two-thirds, and then full throttle, and then no throttle at all.
And then there's another key that how much power you have to the tractor beam.
And then there's another key for switching between targets.
But then you can save those targets by hitting shift + F5, or like shift + F6.
And then you got two save spots, so if you wanna re-target a ship you had pi-, you had targeted hours ago, you can go back to that ship so you can re-target it.

JACK:
Jesus Christ.

RICH:
It's, it's like a science fiction flight simulator, all right?
It's like Microsoft Flight: Spaceships.

JACK:
This sounds terribly boring.

RICH:
It sounds terribly complicated.

JACK:
Uh-huh.

RICH:
And, and, and it's, it's wonderful.
I'm sure in Rogue, Rogue Squadron, it's great just to shoot at things.

JACK:
Sure.

RICH:
But this,
 it's like you have to know what your'e doing in order to shoot at the things.
And for me, personally, it just makes it that much more satisfying.
It's like you're not just following a ship.
You gotta worry about throttliing down, because he's decreasing his speed, hoping you'll overshoot him so he can get a beat on you.
So you gotta be careful about what speed you're flying around.
But if you slow down in order to shoot the guy behind you, you're slowing down, so other, other ships might be getting on your back then to shoot at you.
So you might have to dodge really quick.
It's great!
It's great.
And that's, that's just the flying mechanics, all right?

JACK:
There's more?

RICH:
There's more to this game.
Um, I, I love kind of the way they handle difficulty.
There are primary objectives which are simple enough to do, where just, defend the, the base.
And if you defend the base, you, you got the primary objective, you go on to the next level, right?
There's also secondary objectives.
Secondary extra things you can do to further the Empire's goals because you're an evil motherfucking TIE fighter pilot who's trying to crush the Rebellion...

JACK:
Okay.

RICH:
And preserve peace and order in the galaxy from those chaotic Rebel motherfuckers and the pirate scum they hang out with.
So, so, in the secondary objective, instead of just defending the base, they might want you to, like, use your systems to scan what's on the other ships so they know what kind of supplies that the enemy forces are using.
And you might, you might get more points just by doing the secondary objectives.
But it's harder to do.
You know?
Instead, of just shooting at that ship that's in front of you, you might have to get close enough to scan it first.
And then outside of the primary objectives and the secondary objectives, there are secret objectives, which means you're going above and beyond to preserve the Empire.

JACK:
You're a nerd.

RICH
 like, it sounds like a game that would have an incredible learning curve, but once you got the muscle memory down to know what everything does, it would be an incredibly immersive experience.

RICH:
I, I can definitely attest to the fact that it's immersive.
As far as the learning curve, I've been playing this game since I was a younger person.
Basically, I, I've played the game since the time it came out originally.
So I, I can't even say how long it takes to get into it because I've, I've been into it ever since.

JACK:
But it is newly-released.

RICH:
New, newly-released on gog.com.

PALPATINE:
The Empire is on the verge of success.
RICH:
So, Jack.
What else have you been playing lately?

JACK:
I've been playing a game called Teleglitch.
And to contrast with the crazy complexity of TIE Fighter, this is a top-down twin-stick shooter.
You play as a scientist working on experimental teleportation technology, and everything goes wrong.
So you need to fight your way out of your complex from zombies, monsters, and robots.
I really have been getting into it because it's a game that has an incredible atmosphere to it.
It, it does this very strange thing.
With t-, usually in top-down games, you can kind of see the entire arena, right?
And so even if there is a wall in front of you, you can see on the other side of it.
This does a very unique thing with how it handles its walls and pillars, where you can't see around them, so everything is line-of-sight.
So monsters could be hiding right around the corner and you would never know.
I'm gonna call this game nauseating.
It's nauseating in a great way where there's no music to the game.
There's no soundtrack.
It has beautiful sound to it, like all the enemies sound really creepy.
And there's this ever-present, like, hum of a generator off in the distance.
And so it just has this, like, guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh cpnstant hum.
And once in a while, yoiu'll come across the teleglitch.
The teleporter technology has ripped holes in the fabric of reality, and so there are these, like, black gooey areas that have these, like, chromatic aberrations coming out from them.
They're like, they almost look like they're separating the RGB layers.
And they kill you instantly if you walk into them.
And so, but then, and they also have this, like, weird wogh-wugh-wough-wough-wough.
Right, so there's like guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-guh-wough-wough.
Everything sounds awful,
It's great.
It was a small three-man development team, and they made this incredibly deep, challenging atmospheric game, so I think it's worth it.
Even though I will probably stop playing it because of how hard it is.
It's just so hard.

RICH:
Jack, what else have you been playing?

JACK:
I"ve been playing a game that's a top-down, twin-stick shooter, roguelike, randomly-generated game.
There are games I like.

RICH:
Would, would that game happen to be Binding of Isaac: Rebirth?

JACK:
I've been playing the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.
And I've been playing it a lot.
I've been playing it so much, I've been derelict in my other duties because I've been playing it so much.
So you play as this little naked boy who cries on monsters.
And you are running away from your mother who is trying to kill you.
I think the person who made this game has some mother issues.

RICH:
I, I know you're a fan of Isaac.
And this is the new one, Rebirth.
What is different?
Because I've seen a little bit of it.
Plot-wise, it sounds like it's the same plot.
What, what does Rebirth bring to the table that original Isaac does not?

JACK:
That's the thing.
Rebirth is a remake of The Binding of Isaac, um, which came out a few years ago and became this kind of underground hit.
What it adds is basically a lot of polish.
The, the original game was kind of janky to get running on your system.
You didn't, it didn't have controller support, even though it's a twin-stick shooter.
Had some bugs here and there.
Uh, so it fixes all that.
Adds controller support.
Adds the originally intended pixel art style of the game, which he couldn't do at the time.
Also adds literally hundreds of new items.
Oh.
They also added these new monsters, and one of the monsters pukes on you.
That's what he does.
And he farts, and, and he has diarrhea, and it's...

RICH:
That sounds horribly childish.

JACK:
It is.
And I love it.


RICH:
Childish in a horribly awful, disturbed way.

JACK:
There's one power-up that gives you a unicorn horn that gives your rainbow invincibility powers.

RICH:
Mm-hmm.


JACK:
And there's another power-up that sticks toothpicks in your eyes so you cry more.
Yet it all kinds of flows together, which is a hard thing to accomplish, I feel.
And so it, it mixes this very werid story with very tight gameplay.
And it's, it's all meshed together in 
this game that I could play just forever.
It's got a good soundtrack.
It has, it has memorable monsters.
It has memorable power-ups.
And it's one of those roguelikes that's so difficult that when you win, and you're alone in your room, you pump your fists in thei air and you hope nobody notices it.
So, RIch.
What have you been playing?


RICH:
Well, it will come as no surprise to anybody that I have been playing FTL.
FTL is, it, it's, it was my first experience with a roguelike game.

JACK:
Okay.


RICH:
And I, I think they might be calling them "rogue-lites" now, because I guess roguelike games aren't much like Rogue.
But I, who gives a shit about that?
Uh, it, it's a game where you, you are given a little starship, and it's got a modest amount of weapons.
And you got a  small crew.
And you have to lfy through space.
You have to get from one end of space to all the way to the other end of space.
You getta, you get, you get to fly through, you know, one sector...

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
And one sector's a star map with a bunch of maps, and once you fly to a nearby star, some kind of event happens.
Every jump in FTL is like a new little self-contained adventure.
You go to the planet, and there are alien spiders attacking.
And do you choose to help them or not?
And, you know, if you choose to help them, you might beat the spiders back and get some scrap.
Or you'll probably lose a crew member, because the spiders killed 'em.
So never, never fight alien spiders.
But stilll, something different happens at each map, at each little starpoint.
More often than not, you have to fight another starship.
And then you pit your crew and weapons against them, and you can, you can target areas on the other ships.
You have to be smart about what you're shooting at.

JACK:
Shooting at different parts of their ship.
Damage different systems.

RICH:
Right.

JACK:
And so you, as captain, get to make all the choices.
What you're shooter is shooting at, you know?
It could be the door systems.
It could help you.
You don't know.

RICH:
I know you'd be far better off shooting at their weapons.

JACK:
Maybe.

RICH:
But maybe, maybe the enemies have a lot of shields, so you wanna take those shields down first so you can actually do serious damage on their weapons.
You have to make these kinds of decisions when playing FTL.
I've actually unlocked everything.
In FTL, there's like eight, eight differnt ships you can unlock, and every ship has three different layouts.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
I've had them all for, like, a month now.
But I keep playing the game.
There's nothing left for me to do in the game.
I've done it all.
But I keep playing the game.
I'm trying to figure out why.
And it might be because victory is not guaranteed.

JACK:
Mm-hmm.

RICH:
So, maybe because it's still something of a challenge?
I don't know.
But I know, I know I enjoy it a lot.

JACK:
In these games, there is this randomly-generated content, which means you will not be getting the same items, the same powers, every time you play these games.
And there is a psychological theory, uh, by noted psychologist B. F. Skinner, and it's caclled Variable Interval Reinforcement.
And what this says -- I had to write it down --  because that's a, those are big words.
He put rats and pigeons in these boxes.
And he set up a little button for them ti press.
And every time they pressed a button, they would get a little food pellet.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And then, you know, they would get a food pellet, they'd eat, they'd go about their day, and whenever they were hungry, they'd press the food pellet.
And he said to himself,
"How can we get them to press the button more?"
And so instead of 100% reinforcement -- whenever they pressed the button, they'd get food -- he would give them randomized reinforcement.
So they could press the button ten times and no food, but then the eleventh time they'd get food.
Then they'd press the button four times -- nothing.
The fifth time, they'd get food, right?

RICH:
Randomly-generated rewards.

JACK:
Randomly-generated rewards.
And what he found was that all they would do is constantly press the button.
Because they never knew if they were gonna get food or not, so they would just press the button all fucking day.

RICH:
This sounds both fascinating and horribly cruel.

JACK:
Yes.

RICH:
Well...

JACK:
Let's, let's think about a game in which you get regular rewards, like an RPG, in which you fight a monster, you get the same amount of XP every time you defeat that monster.
What happens?
The grind.

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
The boring grind, where you're kind of half-assedly fighting monsters until you get to the boss, and that's the big exciting battle.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
So imagine these randomly-generated roguelike games where any boss could be crazy powerful, could give you any item, right?
In FTL, if you blow up a ship, you could get an amazing weapon.
You could get a ton of scrap.
It's randomized.
So because the, the outcome isn't set, and the reward isn't set, it's both a challenge -- because you don't wanna die because you have to start over the game -- and there's that excitement about what your reward could be.

RICH:
Hm.
Hmm...

JACK:
It's, its's really interesting because, if you think about it, every battle in FTL is an exciting battle.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
And part of that is because, like, you're thinking about, like,
"Ooh, what scrap am I gonna get?"
"Ooh, maybe if I beat these guys, I'll get an extra crew member."

RICH:
Yeah.
Yeah.

JACK:
Maybe I'll get a new weapon, right?

RICH:
Huh.

JACK:
So that's what makes these randomly-generated games so enticing is not knowing the reward we'll get.

RICH:
Because, you know, Mario, I mean, it's the same thing.
Every single time with Mario.
You know what World 1-1's gonna look like.
You know what World 1-2's gonna look like.
And, and you know.
It's, it's always there.
Not, not so with FTL.

JACK:
Nope.

RICH:
No.

JACK:
And that's part of the excitement.

RICH:
What is it about us?
Because we've, we've streamed FTL a number of times, right?

JACK:
Yeah.

RICH:
And there's always people who say,
"It looks boring."
Why?

JACK:
I don't, I don't know.

RICH:
Do, do you think if those people actually played the game, it would be appealing and they would get it?

JACK:
I don't know.
It's, it's hard.

RICH:
Or do we just like boring things?

JACK:
I am a twitchy arcade gamer.

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
I want the shoot-em-ups.
I want the bullet hells.
I want all of the action.
I find more excitement in FTL than I do in most modern video games.
Even though you can pause it at any moment.

RICH:
Call of Duty.

JACK:
Listen.
I found FTL to be more exciting than Titanfall.

RICH:
Oh, yeah.
Easily.

JACK:
Bec-, and so, anyone who says FTL is boring, you know, it's just not their kind of game.

RICH:
Or maybe they're dumb.

JACK:
Or maybe...
So to kind of wrap up...

RICH:
Yeah.

JACK:
How do we wrap this up?

RICH:
We, I...
Exactly like that.
